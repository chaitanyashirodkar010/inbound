                    <p>Idea Catalyst is an SEO and thought leadership marketing company. We generate leads for
                        businesses by ghostwriting content for their website, specializing in complex subject areas. Our
                        client list includes Yourmechanic.com, Wellness.com and many other Silicon Valley Startups, but
                        the majority of our clients are small and midsized companies and established startups. Our
                        customer composition is approximately 65% B2B and 35% B2C.
                        We begin a campaign by assembling a team that deeply understands your business and customer
                        base; crafting a strategy for addressing the needs and concerns of your prospects through
                        content; and producing a regular stream of thought leadership content that produces qualified
                        leads at a low CAC. We track results carefully and are accountable for exceeding your marketing
                        benchmarks. </p>

                    <p>We are an excellence-driven company that puts our clients – and their marketing goals – first.
